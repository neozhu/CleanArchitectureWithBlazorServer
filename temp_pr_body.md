## Overview

This pull request removes static server rendering from the Blazor Server application and simplifies the authentication mechanism by eliminating the dependency on Razor Pages for cookie authentication. Additionally, this refactoring streamlines the internationalization system by reducing the supported languages to three core languages.

## Changes Made

### üîß Authentication Refactoring
- **Removed static server rendering**: Eliminated static server rendering components that were causing complexity in the authentication flow
- **Simplified cookie authentication**: Cookie authentication no longer requires Razor Pages, streamlining the authentication process
- **Interactive authentication**: Enhanced the interactive authentication experience by focusing purely on Blazor Server's interactive rendering model

### üåê Internationalization Optimization
- **Reduced language support**: Removed extensive multi-language support to focus on three core languages
- **Retained languages**: German (DE), English (EN), and Chinese (ZH) are maintained as the primary supported languages
- **Simplified localization**: Streamlined the localization infrastructure by removing unused language resources
- **Improved maintainability**: Reduced complexity in resource management and translation maintenance

### üöÄ Benefits
- **Reduced complexity**: Simplified architecture by removing unnecessary static rendering components and unused language resources
- **Improved performance**: Eliminated overhead from static server rendering and reduced localization bundle size
- **Better user experience**: More consistent interactive authentication flow with focused language support
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with fewer authentication pathways and streamlined localization
- **Reduced bundle size**: Smaller application footprint due to removed language resources

### üîç Technical Details
- Removed static server rendering configurations
- Updated authentication middleware to work exclusively with interactive rendering
- Simplified cookie authentication flow without Razor Pages dependency
- Enhanced Blazor Server interactive authentication components
- Removed unused language resource files and localization configurations
- Maintained German, English, and Chinese language support infrastructure

## Testing
- [ ] Authentication flows tested with interactive rendering
- [ ] Cookie authentication works correctly without Razor Pages
- [ ] Language switching works correctly for German, English, and Chinese
- [ ] Localization resources are properly loaded for supported languages
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance improvements verified

## Breaking Changes
- Static server rendering is no longer supported
- Applications relying on static server rendering will need to be updated to use interactive rendering
- **Multi-language support reduced**: Only German, English, and Chinese languages are now supported
- Previously supported languages (if any) will need to be re-implemented if required

## Migration Guide
For applications currently using static server rendering:
1. Update authentication configurations to use interactive rendering
2. Replace static components with interactive Blazor components
3. Update any custom authentication logic to work with the new flow

For applications using other languages:
1. Verify that your application uses one of the supported languages (German, English, Chinese)
2. Update any custom localization logic to work with the streamlined language support
3. Consider implementing additional language support if needed using the existing infrastructure

This refactoring aligns with modern Blazor Server best practices and provides a cleaner, more maintainable authentication system with focused internationalization support.
